<h1>REST</h1>

Why create this app in such a fashion when all that was needed is a little bit of code and some widgets? I am demonstrating how to implement the MVC
(Model View COntroller) architecture. To do this I built a database which can create, delete, update, and read the entries so users can interact
with the schedule virtually while saving money by not needing to hand out physical copies of the document. While version 1.0 is not all glitz and
glam it is instead functional and easy on the eyes. This is a great success to me. I am proud to bring you the REST Center of Lewiston android app.
