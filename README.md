All Java based Android apps will go here. In the future apks will be released for ease of access because I found that moving a project and renaming it is not easy. You can download the project and as long as you have Android Studio installed it will recognize the framework. These projects will use SDK tools 29 for as long that is suitable. I reccomend a Nexus 5 with API 24 as a virtual device for testing purposes. The minumum API for these projects will 15 for 100% compatibility.
