# Java Based Android Development

In the future apks will be released for ease of access because I found that moving a project and renaming it is not easy. You can download the project and as long as you have Android Studio installed it will recognize the framework.

# Reccomeneded Settings and tools

SDK tools - 29+<br/>

Minumum API - 16 (increased for Firebase)<br/>

# App descriptions

## AddingApp 

A very simple app that adds two numbers. Nothing special here.

## Quicklauncher
 
An app which goes to a second activity and goes to a website. The google button will query the Android device to find an appliction which can handle the desired request.

# Builds

1. ListView -- debug (see notes)
2. LoginLogout -- debug (see note)

## Notes

10/29/19 -- The ListView app requires that you allow unknown sources to be installed on your phone. For ease of install (post Android 6.0 has native compression/decompression) please download the ListApp_debug.zip package in the APKs/debug folder and extract the ListApp_debug.apk. No permission are required.

10/29/19 -- LoginLogout requires internet permissions and is unsigned. Cannot log out yet. That is coming next along with creating an account.
