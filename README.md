##Java Based Android Development

In the future apks will be released for ease of access because I found that moving a project and renaming it is not easy. You can download the project and as long as you have Android Studio installed it will recognize the framework.

##Reccomeneded Settings

SDK tools - 29
reccomend virtual device -- Nexus 5 with API 24
Minumum API - 16 (increased for Firebase)

##App descriptions

#AddingApp -- A very simple app that adds two numbers. Nothing special here.

#Quicklauncher -- An app which goes to a second activity and goes to a website. The google button will query the Android device to find an appliction which can handle the desired request.

##Builds

1. ListView -- debug (see notes)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

##Notes

10/29/19 -- The ListView app requires that you allow unknon sources to be installed on your phone. For ease of install (post Android 6.0 has native compression/decmpression) please download the ListApp_debug.zip package in the APKs/debug folder and extract the ListApp_debug.apk. No permission are required.
