# Activity Life Cycle

## What is it?
Understanding how to implement and code inside of the different states of an actvity. The fives states of an Activity are onCreate,
onStart, onStop, onResume/onPostResume, and OnDestroy. Note: onPostResume is correct and used for AppCompactActivity while onResume 
is reserved for Activity which lacks app compatibility and is important.
