## Shared Preferences
Shared preferences is a way of storing data to the drive with Android. The data is inside of an xml file and even when the app is closed 
the data is still persistent. When you enter some text into the EditText the string is saved as a variable, written to disk, and shown
in the TextView. This is a simple example for me to make sense out of it before being used in a practical sense.
